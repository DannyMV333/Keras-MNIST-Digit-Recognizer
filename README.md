# Keras-MNIST-Digit-Recognizer
This project demonstrates building and training a neural network with Keras (TensorFlow) to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. It covers data preprocessing, model creation (dense layers, dropout), compilation, training, and evaluation, offering a clear introduction to image classification fundamentals.
